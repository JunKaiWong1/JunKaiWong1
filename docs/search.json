    "text": "One Piece Trading Card Game\n\nIt is quite a new TCG that released on July 8th, 2022. My friend introduced to me about this game and I started to play it last year December. I have always like to play TCG during my childhood days but do not have the chance to play it. I am glad that I have the chance to play it now. I have been playing this game for 6 months and I am still learning the game. I have a few friends that play this game with me and we always have fun playing it. I am looking forward to play this game with more people and make more friends.\n\n\n\nMy First Win Throughout the 6 months, i have finally achieve my first victory in the game. I was so happy that I have finally won a game. I have been losing a lot of games and I was quite demoralised. I am glad that I have finally won a game. I will continue to play this game and improve my skills. I hope to win more games in the future."
